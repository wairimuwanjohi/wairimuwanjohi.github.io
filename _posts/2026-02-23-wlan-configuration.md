## Problem Statement
Configure a secure wireless LAN environment including SSID setup, encryption, and access restrictions.

## Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer  
- Wireless access points  
- Network security protocols (WPA2/WPA3)  

## Approach
1. Set up access points and configured SSIDs.  
2. Applied WPA2 encryption and strong passphrases for each SSID.  
3. Implemented MAC address filtering for authorized devices.  
4. Assigned VLANs to segregate wireless traffic.  
5. Tested connectivity and access restrictions for authorized and unauthorized devices.  

## Key Results
- Authorized devices connected successfully, unauthorized devices were blocked.  
- VLAN segregation maintained network security between different SSIDs.  
- Wireless encryption protected data traffic from interception.  

## Lessons Learned
- Proper WLAN configuration is critical for network security.  
- VLAN assignment for wireless networks ensures separation of traffic.  
- MAC filtering adds an additional security layer but should not be the sole control.  

## Skills Demonstrated
- WLAN configuration and security  
- Practical implementation of WPA2 encryption  
- Troubleshooting wireless network connectivity
