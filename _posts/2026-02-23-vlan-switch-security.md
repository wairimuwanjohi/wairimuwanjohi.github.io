## Problem Statement
Configure VLANs and implement secure switch settings to isolate network traffic, enhance security, and practice network segmentation.

## Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer  
- Switches and routers (simulated)  
- CLI commands for VLAN and port security configuration  

## Approach
1. Designed VLAN topology according to lab instructions.  
2. Created VLANs and assigned switch ports to the correct VLAN.  
3. Configured trunk links between switches to allow inter-VLAN routing.  
4. Enabled port security to prevent unauthorized device connections.  
5. Disabled unused ports and applied best practice security measures.  
6. Verified connectivity within VLANs and isolation between VLANs.  

## Key Results
- Devices in the same VLAN communicated correctly.  
- VLAN separation successfully restricted inter-VLAN traffic without routing.  
- Port security blocked unauthorized devices from connecting to switches.  

## Lessons Learned
- Proper VLAN planning improves both performance and security.  
- Misconfigured trunks can cause connectivity issues across VLANs.  
- Port security is an essential safeguard against unauthorized access.  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Network segmentation and switch hardening  
- Troubleshooting VLAN connectivity  
- Practical configuration of Cisco devices in a simulated environment
