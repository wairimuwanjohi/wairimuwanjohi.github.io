## Problem Statement
Analyze network traffic captures to identify anomalies, understand communication patterns, and detect potential security threats.

## Tools Used
- Wireshark  
- Kali Linux  
- Network capture files from Hack The Box room  

## Approach
1. Opened packet capture files in Wireshark.  
2. Filtered traffic to focus on suspicious IP addresses and protocols.  
3. Analyzed packet headers for unusual patterns and potential attack vectors.  
4. Documented findings including protocol use, traffic volume, and anomalies.  
5. Cross-referenced findings with room objectives to identify vulnerabilities.  

## Key Results
- Detected irregular traffic patterns indicating possible reconnaissance activity.  
- Identified unencrypted communications that could be exploited.  
- Successfully mapped host interactions and network layout based on packet captures.  

## Lessons Learned
- Network traffic analysis is essential for detecting early-stage attacks.  
- Wireshark filtering and protocol inspection streamline anomaly detection.  
- Attention to detail is critical when analyzing large packet capture files.  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Network traffic capture analysis  
- Security monitoring and anomaly detection  
- Practical application of Wireshark for cybersecurity investigations
